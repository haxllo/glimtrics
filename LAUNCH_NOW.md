## 🚨 **EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: "No one is signing up"**

**Likely causes:**
1. Your posts aren't getting views → Post on more platforms
2. Value prop isn't clear → Update landing page copy
3. People don't trust it → Add demo video (Loom, 2 minutes)
4. Wrong audience → Try different subreddits

**Fix:** Message 20 people directly. Get feedback on WHY they didn't sign up.

---

### **Problem: "People sign up but don't upload files"**

**Likely causes:**
1. Upload unclear → Add sample CSV files
2. Technical issues → Check error logs
3. Don't have data → Provide demo datasets

**Fix:** Email them: "Hey! Saw you signed up. Need help getting started?"

---

### **Problem: "Getting negative feedback"**

**This is GOOD!** Means people tried it.

**How to respond:**
```
"Thanks for the feedback! You're right, [acknowledge their point]. 
I'm adding [their request] to my roadmap. Would love to keep you 
updated when it's ready - mind if I email you?"
```

**Turn critics into advisors.**

---
